	<h1>Exact Change </h1>
	<p>Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.</p>
	<p>cid is a 2D array listing available currency</p>
	<p>Return the string "Insufficient Funds" if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due. Return the string "Closed" if cash-in-drawer is equal to the change due.</p>
	<p>Otherwise, return change in coin and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order.</p>
