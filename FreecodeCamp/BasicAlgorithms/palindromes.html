	<h1>Check for Palindromes</h1>
	<p>Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.</p>
	<p>A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.</p>
	<p>Note
You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything lower case in order to check for palindromes.</p>
	<p>We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.</p>
	<p>We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2".</p>
