	<h1>DNA Pairing</h1>
	<p>The DNA strand is missing the pairing element. Take each character, get its pair, and return the results as a 2d array.</p>
	<p>Base pairs are a pair of AT and CG. Match the missing element to the provided character.</p>
	<p>Return the provided character as the first element in each array.</p>
	<p>For example, for the input GCG, return [["G", "C"], ["C","G"],["G", "C"]]</p>
	<p>The character and its pair are paired up in an array, and all the arrays are grouped into one encapsulating array.</p>
