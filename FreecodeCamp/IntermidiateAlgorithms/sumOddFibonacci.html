	<h1>Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers</h1>
	<p>Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num.</p>
	<p>The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.</p>
	<p>For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.</p>
